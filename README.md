# python-basics
Basics of python for those with Matlab experience. This tutorial was created for learning the basics of python by example. These examples use Jupyter notebook which is an open-source web application that allows for the easy sharing of python code and visualizations.

## Getting Started
You can either read the python examples on github or run jupyter notebook locally. To run locally make sure to have python3 install on your system. Also, you will need the following 3d party libaries: jupyter, numpy and matplotlib. You can install these libaries using pip or conda. You can use pip with the commandline if you have python already installed. Otherwise, I would recommend installing Minianaconda to be able to use the conda package manager.

Installation with pip:

``` 
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib
```

Installation with conda
```
conda create -n basics python=3.6 jupyter numpy matplotlib
```
Then to activate virtual environment with `source activate basic` (Mac) or `activate basic` (PC)

After installation run jupyter-notebook with:

```
python jupyter
```
